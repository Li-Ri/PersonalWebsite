              My name is Liam and I am a Software Developer. I began my journey
              into software development while undertaking my masterâ€™s degree in
              Aerospace Engineering. I decided to learn python for academic
              projects which led me to create small personal projects to help my
              work flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this initial exposure to programming I was hooked and so I
              began to learn JavaScript to build on the foundation i had learnt
              with Python and begin building more ambitious web applications
              with frameworks and libraries such as Express and React.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found a sincere passion for software development and what it
              means to be a software engineer. Although I am at the beginning of
              my Software Development Journey, I am fully committed to being a
              great engineer.

              Feel free to check out my projects and contact me if you have any
              questions.
